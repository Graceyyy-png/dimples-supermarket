          Excel Saga is based on a popular manga of the same name. It is about
          a secret ideological organization whose purpose is world domination.
          The entire Excel Saga is available to watch except for its last
          episode, called “Going Too Far”  very fitting indeed. It is even
          banned in its home country, Japan. The reason why this episode got
          banned is that it's too long, violent, pornographic, and offensive.
          Fun fact: The Director of the show, Shinichi Watanabe, purposely got
          the last episode banned to make it daring and unforgettable. The
          last episode of Excel Saga is only available on DVD.

        <p>
          Death note is one of the most famous anime shows ever and while it's
          gruesome, bloody and horrific, it is easily available on mainstream
          platforms, including Netflix. However, there is still a country that
          did not appreciate the dark premise of this show. Death Note is
          banned in China due to its theme. The show is about death, justice,
          murder and violence so it is considered as a corrupting influence on
          kids.

          Another cult-favorite anime on the lists is Attack on Titan. Due to
          its bloody, disgusting and disturbing visuals, it has been banned in
          China. While millions of viewers love this anime, China thinks this
          show portrays a lot of excessive violence which is very unhealthy
          for the younger audience. With that being said, if you are 18 and
          above, do not miss out on Attack on Titan. It is truly one of the
          best anime out there!

          With very high viewer ratings, it's a bit of shock to see this show
          on the list. High School DxD follows the story of Issei Hyodo, a
          perverted high school kid who is killed on his very first date. But
          he gets reincarnated by Rias Gremory as a demon. Now, how come a
          show about angles and demons gets banned? Well, the premise of the
          show focuses on corrupt high school kids with a perverted mindset.
          This show is very sexual and shows a lot of nudity in certain
          scenes. This is why New Zealand has banned High School DxD for its
          sexual, harem themes based around high school kids.

    <h5>About us</h5>
    Anime is basically Japanese fiction. It has a variety of genres like love, gambling, fantasy, horror, mystery,
    thriller, adventure, gaming, etc. However, the characters are drawn differently than cartoon characters.
    That's why, you'll find anime graphics almost the same as other animes

    The rarest animal in the world is the vaquita (Phocoena sinus). It is a kind of critically endangered porpoise that only lives in the furthest north-western corner of the Gulf of California in Mexico. There are only 18 left in the world.
    A rare species is a group of organisms that are very uncommon, scarce, or infrequently encountered. This designation may be applied to either a plant or animal taxon, and is distinct from the term endangered or threatened.
