          It has a very dark, depressing, and intense storyline and it is
          considered one of the most controversial anime movies ever. This is
          a 1992 anime film about a young girl whose mother dies. The girl
          meets a man who tells her he will help her if she ever needs
          anything. So, after her mother's death, she goes to find the man and
          ends up at a circus where she gets abused and raped. Thus, Shoujo
          Tsubaki is about child sexual abuse with unbearable gore scenes. The
          horrific and disturbing visuals of this anime have left many viewers
          traumatized,so much so that the tapes of this film were also
          destroyed. Therefore, Shoujo Tsubaki is banned almost everywhere,
          including Japan itself.

      <h5>About us</h5>
      Anime is basically Japanese fiction. It has a variety of genres like love, gambling, fantasy, horror, mystery,
      thriller, adventure, gaming, etc. However, the characters are drawn differently than cartoon characters.
      That's why, you'll find anime graphics almost the same as other animes

      The rarest animal in the world is the vaquita (Phocoena sinus). It is a kind of critically endangered porpoise that only lives in the furthest north-western corner of the Gulf of California in Mexico. There are only 18 left in the world.
      A rare species is a group of organisms that are very uncommon, scarce, or infrequently encountered. This designation may be applied to either a plant or animal taxon, and is distinct from the term endangered or threatened.
